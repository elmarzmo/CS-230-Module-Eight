1. Brief Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements:
The Gaming Room, our client, sought the development of a cross-platform web-based game, Draw It or Lose It. This game, an expansion of their existing Android app, involves multiple teams guessing phrases from a library of images. The goal was to create a dynamic, engaging experience accessible on various devices.

2. What was done well in developing this documentation:
The documentation for The Gaming Room project shines in its precision, providing a concise yet comprehensive blueprint for Draw It or Lose It. The clear delineation of team dynamics, game mechanics, and the incorporation of unique identifiers reflects an acute grasp of the client's objectives.
3. Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process in Code Development:
The design document served as a roadmap, guiding the development process. The UML diagrams and domain model clarified the relationships between different components. This structured approach facilitated a smoother transition from design to implementation.

4. Part of the Work to Revise and How to Improve:
I would enhance the section on security measures. While the document mentions built-in Windows security, emphasizing additional security layers and encryption methods would further fortify user data protection.

5. Interpretation of User Needs in Software Design:
